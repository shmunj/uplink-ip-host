This small tool is an attempt to replicate one of the (simplest) tools from Uplink, a great video game about hacking.

The tool pretty much just converts a given IP address to hostname and vice versa, but it looks like the tool from the game. Maybe I'll do a similar GUI using other libraries for other tools like John the Ripper etc in order to make a whole Uplink themed toolbox for script kiddies.

It is made in Pygame because Uplink is a game. At the time I thought it was funny...

(The script uses great little module called EzText: http://www.pygame.org/project-EzText-920-.html)
